# Inc-5000-Companies-Analysis

Motivation: 

I have been curious what does private company landscape in the US look like. This project is about analysisng INC-5000 companies. Where we perform some exploratory analaysis. 

Some of the questions I try to explore are as follows: 
How many private companies are there per idustry and what is their average revenue? What industries and states provide high growth opportunities? What does industry spread out look like in top 10 states? 

You can also find other additional analysis in the jupyter notebook. 


Conclusion: The data suggests that if I were to start a business in the Government Services, Virginia would be the best place. However, suppose I am focusing on Advertising & Marketing. In that case, I can start my business from anywhere and grow rapidly (hopefully?).

While some industries like Consumer Products & Services, Energy and Retail offer excellent growth potential. It would be crucial to have a successful business execution strategy to guarantee rapid growth.
